## Deployment

Site deployed at [Charles Fisher](https://cdfishe1.github.io/portfolio/)

## Scope of Project

* Complete creation of html and css.
* Used flex grid and flex box for layout and responsiveness.
* IMPORTANT NOTICE: As of 2/13/2021 I have no complete projects to fill the projects sections of this page.


## Installation

Deploy the html file and assets folder that contains the images and css files on a website host server.

## Noted Resources

I made extensive use of the following resources:

* [Chris Coyer. "A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
* [Chris House. "A Complete Guide to Grid"](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

## Testing

Tested accessibility using [WAVE web accessbility evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://cdfishe1.github.io/portfolio/)

* Generates 0 errors.

Tested responsiveness on Android smart phone and Apple Ipad to insure the page will respond properly to smaller screen sizes.

## Credits

* Radomir "Rad" Fugiel, bootcamp TA, for helping me think about CSS flex grid.
* David Metcalfe, bootcamp tutor, for helping me with media queries and thinking about mobile first design.
